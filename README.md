Business Case
The AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP) is made to improve the university experience using a centralized access point of information and services. Currently, staff, students, and administrators need to use multiple systems which is inefficient. AIDAP addresses the need for a digital assistant that does this through a single conversational interface for tasks such as checking schedules, deadlines and getting notifications.
