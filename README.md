## Business Case
The AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP) is made to improve the university experience using a centralized access point of information and services. Currently, staff, students, and administrators need to use multiple systems, which is inefficient. AIDAP addresses the need for a digital assistant that does this through a single conversational interface for tasks such as checking schedules, deadlines, and getting notifications.

The proposed solution is intended for use by students, lecturers, administrators, and maintainers, with the overarching goal of enhancing student and faculty access to information. Depending on the user, the program features a specific interface. For students, the AIDAP provides a conversational interface that allows them to access schedules, grades, and deadlines. For lecturers, the system provides easier access to easy communication with students and quick course analytics. Overall, the system improves upon the existing systems, such as LMS, by incorporating a conversational interface and personalized information. The maintainers and administrators can also benefit from the system, though it has simplified monitoring and maintenance.

The system's implementation can be considered a success based on some of these metrics: having a large percentage of user adoption, having a quick response time of ~2 seconds for the average query, having a high availability of about 99.5% of the month, and with being connected to the universityâ€™s core systems, such as LMS, registration, and calendar.
